## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- To get a local copy up and running, copy the SSH key of the repository and run `git clone` in your terminal.

### Install
- `npm install`: Install all the dependencies required locally.

### Setup
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
